## About Factly
Started as an idea in 2014, it was in the mid-2010s that Factly moved into the Data journalism space, which was still in its nascent stages in India. By 2015, Factly had evolved from a blog to a company with an aim to transform the public information landscape in India by making data and information meaningful to people. Between 2016-18, Factly launched its own website and boosted the publishing of its in-house articles- this combination of the data stories along with YouTube videos helped Factly gain a foothold in the news media space through increased subscribers to its content. Today, Factly undertakes three broad categories of work - content production; tool-building; and consulting & training projects.
