## Should you choose our managed service?

Our managed service might be a good option if you:

- Do not have the technical resources/capabilities to deploy and manage a highly available platform.
- Do not want to worry about scaling the platform to your organization/audience. 
- Do not want to perform upgrades manually risking downtime of the platform.
- Are exploring VidCheck to see if it is a good fit for your organization or your personal project.
- Want to focus on the core objectives of your organization and not have to deal with the IT services.
- Want quick support for getting started and for any help going forward.

## What other options do you have?

VidCheck is an open source project with a very permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/factly/vidcheck/blob/develop/LICENSE) like most of our other projects. All the features available in the managed service are available for free in the open source version as well. You can read more about the open source version [here](/docs/introduction/self-hosted).

If you are a WordPress user and would rather want to install VidCheck as a plugin instead of a stand-alone service, you could read about our WordPress plugin [here](/docs/introduction/wordpress-plugin).
